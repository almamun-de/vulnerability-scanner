# Vulnerability Scanner

A simple Python-based vulnerability scanner for web servers. This tool checks for:
- Open ports (using `nmap`).
- Security headers in HTTP responses.
- SSL/TLS certificate information.

## How It Works
The scanner performs three checks:
1. **Port Scanning**: It scans common ports (1-1024) to identify open ones.
2. **Security Headers Check**: It checks for important security headers in the HTTP response, such as `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, and `Strict-Transport-Security`.
3. **SSL/TLS Check**: It retrieves and displays SSL certificate information like validity period and issuer.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `nmap` (You need to have `nmap` installed on your system)
- Python libraries: `requests`, `python-nmap`

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
